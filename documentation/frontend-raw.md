# Frontend development
having finished our postgresql database, at least for the timeseries, we start to think you this can you accesses from the webpage. How I will do this is as follows:
Use open layers to investigate what information can be gained, how can countries be made clickable such that the user is provided with options and an isocode is provided such that one can search within the database.

Graph timeseries:

Module bundlers, parcel for this (build tool).
Maar ook dit faalt haha.

## Openlayers

## Timeseries prototype
This is a small project, showing a page with the numbers 0 until 100, when you click a number a form pops up, asking to specify which indicator and timeperiod, then returs a graph of that isocode, indicator and timeperiod.
Has to interact with the database, this can be achieved through php easily.

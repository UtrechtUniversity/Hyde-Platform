      <p> The <strong>Neolithic era (10000 B.C. - 3000 B.C.)</strong> marked humanity's transition from a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle to settled agricultural communities. Agricultural practices emerged independently in various regions, including the Fertile Crescent, China, Mesoamerica, and the Andes.
      </p><p>This period saw the domestication of plants like wheat, barley, rice, and animals such as goats, sheep, and cattle. The ability to grow crops and domesticate animals led to a surplus of food, enabling permanent settlements. Notable sites like Çatalhöyük and Jericho evidence the establishment of complex societies with social hierarchies, specialized labor, and rudimentary trade systems. The Neolithic era laid the groundwork for technological advancements like pottery-making, weaving, and the construction of megalithic structures, indicating a burgeoning understanding of architecture and craftsmanship.
